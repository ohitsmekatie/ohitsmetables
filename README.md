## Lore & More

I built this website to help with my role playing game world builing and prep all while learning a few new technologies.

- 🐍 Flask for the backend
- 🖋️ Poetry for dependency management
- 💻 Render for deploying
- 🗞️ Google Sheets for a dynamic, easy to populate "database"
- 💄 Bootstrap + custom CSS
- ✨ Font Awesome for icons

On each page load, 5 random bits of lore and inspiration pop up to kickstart your brainstorming process.

There are also a number of random generators for creating new characters, getting random encounters, filling different types of shops, and more!
