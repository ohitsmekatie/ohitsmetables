    <p>
      Hi! I’m <strong>Katie</strong> — a GM  based in <strong>Pittsburgh</strong>, where I live with my <strong>husband</strong> and our many many animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve been playing and running RPGs for years, but recently have been getting more into content creation. I love making maps and RPG related doodles and someday i'll upload those here as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is my way of blending that love of tabletop games with a little bit of web whimsy. I hope it inspires your prep, your play, and your stories!
